Simple Recipe for Homemade Guacamole

Let's begin!

Cut the avocados in half and remove the pit. Scoop out the avocado flesh into a bowl.

Add the diced tomato, finely chopped red onion, minced garlic, and minced jalape√±o pepper to the bowl with the avocado.

Squeeze the lime juice over the ingredients in the bowl and season with salt and pepper.

Use a fork or potato masher to mash the ingredients together until desired consistency is reached.

Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

Serve with tortilla chips or as a topping for tacos or other dishes.
